# Summary

These pulleys interface to a #10 Ball/Bead chain with 4.5mm beads with approximately 5.5mm pitch. 

The larger puller has 20 bead-holes evenly spaced around it's interfacing circumference and is around 34mm in diameter (not including guides). A test print is advised for this version as the previous version of this had slightly incorrect pitch and didn't run smoothly. I have not reprinted the reworked version.

The "more versatile", smaller version is based on the existing pulley in the blinds. It should allow for more variance in the chain and has 12 spaces for beads. I have successfully printed this part (see cover photo).

They should fit a NEMA 14 Stepper motor shaft (5mm, with flat side).
